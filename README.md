# Dosto Desktop

Dosto Desktop is an Electron application that links with Dosto
on [Android](https://github.com/Dostoapp/Dosto-Android)
or [iOS](https://github.com/Dostoapp/Dosto-iOS).

## Install the production version: https://Dosto.org/download/

## Install the beta

You can install the beta version of Dosto Desktop alongside the production version. The beta uses different data and install locations.

- _Windows:_ First, download [this file](https://updates.Dosto.org/desktop/beta.yml) and look for the `url` property that specifies the location for the latest beta installer. Download the installer by constructing a final URL that looks like this: `https://updates.Dosto.org/desktop/<installer location>`. Then run the installer.
- _macOS:_ First, download [this file](https://updates.Dosto.org/desktop/beta-mac.yml) and look for the `url` property that specifies the location for the latest beta installer. Download the installer by constructing a final URL that looks like this: `https://updates.Dosto.org/desktop/<package location>`. Then unzip that package and copy the `.app` file into the `/Applications` folder using Finder.
- _Linux:_ Follow the production instructions to set up the APT repository and run `apt install Dosto-desktop-beta`.
